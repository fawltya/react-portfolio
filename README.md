## Description

**[View my portfolio](https://www.designbarn.co.uk)**

My personal portfolio, with a few words on me, examples of previous projects, and contact info.

I used React to create the site...

It features a dark mode, which saves user preference to local storage.

I used Tailwind to style the site. It works great for things like the contact form, which validates the email field and changes colour on focus/hover/validation.
